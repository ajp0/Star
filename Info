v1: --

tictactoeSave1.py: first day working on python tic tac toe project
tictactoeSave2.py: the second of day working
tictactoeSave3.py: final version of the first version
  problems:
    clicking fast on board would make animations become corrupt 
    gui was crappy
    
game1.py: final version of the first try at tic tac toe in python (tictactoeSave3.py), had issues that made the game annoying to play

v2: --

game2.py: day 4, completely rewrote game1.py from scratch to simplify the code, make it run smoother, new gui, and removed flaws.
  problems:
    couldn't, and still cant, figure out how to access a lot of variables that are in other functions
    I didn't want to make variables global because they are very bad practice, not sure why yet. The local variables, most were being
    used for initialization, I do not know how to pass them through the functions. Didn't think it would be possible through function
    parameters.
    
game3.py: same day, final version of python tic tac toe. Basically everything is working good, to my knowledge 
  one porblemish:
    if you click very fast the turtle animations won't be able to keep up.
